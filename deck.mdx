# Radically Reactive Angular

Joey Aufgang

Technical Lead, CX Mobile

---

# Is this _really_ radical?  You decide.

<Appear>

### Rejected names:

- Really Reactive
- Robustly Reactive
- Relentlessly Reactive
- Refreshingly Reactive
- Rewardingly Reactive

</Appear>

---

# These opinions are my own

- We use these patterns consistently in CX Mobile
- It works well for us
- No mandate to use this for CX Portal / PX Portal etc.
- I personally think any project can benefit from using these patterns

---

# What do I mean by _Radically Reactive_?

<Appear>

An opinionated code style for Angular apps that:

- Uses reactive patterns consistently everywhere throughout the app
- Banishes the use of non-reactive code patterns
- Uses ComponentStore to support this pattern

</Appear>

---

# Is this really radical?

<Appear>

I'm not claiming to have invented anything new here.

Fusion of ideas I've picked up from:

- Victor Savkin - [Managing State in Angular Applications](https://blog.nrwl.io/managing-state-in-angular-applications-22b75ef5625f)
- Deborah Kurata - [Data Composition with RxJS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z76QlSpYcck)
- Alex Okrushko et. al. - [ComponentStore](https://ngrx.io/guide/component-store)

# What are my goals <br/> for this presentation?


<CodeSurferColumns>

<Steps>

<ul>
  <li>Developing a better understanding of reactive programming and it's benefits</li>
  <li>More about <em>why</em> than <em>how</em></li>
  <li>Inspire you to want to learn more and try it out</li>
</ul>

# What is reactive programming?

<Appear>

> "In computing, reactive programming is a declarative _programming paradigm_ concerned with data streams and the _propagation of change_."<br/>
\- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming

</Appear>

---

# What does it mean that "reactive" <br/> is a _programming paradigm_?

<Appear>

### It represents a _style_ of programming that is<br/>conceptually distinct from traditional imperative style

- Not just for dealing with asynchronous data requests, etc.
- Entire apps can be built using reactive patterns

</Appear>

---

# What do we mean by <br/> _propogation of change_?

<Appear>

###  _Dependent_ or _derived_ values update themselves automatically

- _Independent_ means can't be calculated from other values.
  - Data comes from user input, APIs, read from filesystem, etc.
- _Dependent_ means calculated from other values


(Kind of like the way [spreadsheet](https://cisco-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/p/jaufgang/EYDEqkxfvVRLmW7IuCKMGc4Bo1D_QC7aRWp2OJBjTFZD5Q) cells with <br/>formulas and cell references update themselves)

</Appear>

---

## In concrete terms,<br/> in the context of Angular,<br/>reactive programming means:

<Appear>

- Using RxJS

</Appear>

---

# I know what you're thinking

<Appear>

### "But we already use RxJS throughout the apps that we build!"

- Do we  use it everywhere or only when data is handed to us as observable?
- How do we handle a mixture of observable and non-observable data in a component?
  - Subscribe to the observable and write the value to a non-observable property?
  - Or immediately make the non-observable data observable

</Appear>

# Imperative

- Component properties are just buckets that hold values
- Properties are written to by methods, which then need keep track of and update any additional dependent properties
- No clear differentiation between independent and dependent state
- Declaration and definition are disconnected
  - The meaning can be distributed throughout the component or service across many functions (spaghetti code)
- Relationships between values are unclear
- Hard to read and understand, especialy as component grows in complexity

---

#  Reactive

- Independent state properties are stored in an observable
- Dependent/derived state properties are declared as observables that read from other observabes
- Observable properties declare the value and its definition together
- Clear differentiation between independent and dependent properties
- Methods that update independent state properties have one job only
  - Don't need to be aware of dependent properties or be responsible for updating them
- Relationships between dependent values are clear, explicit, and hierarchical
  - No spaghetti

---

<img src={insight} />

# Key insights

<Appear>

- Imperatively managing propagation of change is a driver of unnecessary complexity in code.
- Reactive programming was designed to address this problem.
- "Observability" is the innovation that enables the automatic propagation of change.
- Recognizing this and learning to take advantage of it is the first step towards simpler code and a better tomorrow.

# Is Angular a reactive framework?

<CodeSurferColumns>


<Step>

Yes and no. <br/> Actually, it has a split personality

<img src={split} />

</Step>


<Step>

| | Imperative | Reactive |
|--- |---	|---	|
| | Inputs | HttpClient |
| | ViewChildren |  Router Events |
| | NgOnChanges | Route Params  |
| |  Template driven forms	| Reactive Forms *  |

<img src={split} />

# Why was Angular <br/> designed this way?

<Appear>

A set of compromises intended to balance:

- The power of reactive programming
- Ability for new Angular developers to learn the framework

</Appear>

---

# Where does this leave us?

<Appear>

### Angular apps that are commonly  an incoherent  <br/> mishmash of imperative and reactive styles

- Templates where some bindings use async pipe and others do not in seemingly random pattern
- Some observable properties are used both reactively and unreactively at the same time:
  - Bound to template with `async` pipe
  - Also subscribed to in the component to be combined with non-observable data to imperatively compute additional dependent values
- Need to explicitly manage subscriptions/unsubscription
- Vulnerable to pitfalls when using onPush change detection

</Appear>

---

# This is not your fault!

<Appear>

- Most Angular documentation, courses, etc teaches you this way
- Until recently there wasn't a really great way<br/>to make the non-reactive parts more reactive


<img src={subscribe} />


</Appear>

---

# How do we fix this?

<Appear>

<img src={noHalfMeasures} />

### Time to get _radically_ reactive

</Appear>

---

# How do we fix this?


- Unlearn much of what we've been taught
- Adopt a new way of thinking
- Stop using non-reactive patterns, even if you've<br/> seen them in the Angular docs or other sources
- Think of imperative patterns as training wheels <br/> to learn Angular, then graduate away from it
- Start using _ComponentStore_ <br/>to help make components reactive

# ComponentStore

<Appear>

- What is it and how will it change my life?

</CodeSurfer>

---

# What ComponentStore gives us

<Appear>

- A built-in observable called state$ for storing all _independent_ component values in a consolidated place
  - A "home" for _independent_ component properties
- Utility functions for updating and selecting values from the state$
- Utility function for creating effects which provide reactive api for side effects

</Appear>

---

# What about those non-observable <br/> parts of Angular, like inputs?

---

# Use this one weird trick<br/>to make your components<br/>more reactive!

<Appear>

- Using setters with Angular decorators

```ts
@Input()
set someInput(someValue : someType) {
    this.setSomeValue(someValue)
}
```

(Also works with ViewChildren, etc.)

#  Composing observables


<Appear>

- Combine all observable data to be used in the component's template into a single observable "view model" called vm$
- Subscribe to vm$ in the template once using async pipe at the component root
- Reference the subscribed view model everywhere else in the template
- Avoid any other template bindings that don't use this pattern

# Effects

### Effects are designed to extract any side-effects (such as Network calls) from components and handle potential race conditions.

<Appear>

- Effects isolate side effects from components, allowing for more pure components that select state and trigger updates and/or effects in ComponentStore(s).
- Effects are Observables listening for the inputs and piping them through the "prescription".
- Those inputs can either be values or Observables of values.
- Effects perform tasks, which are synchronous or asynchronous.

#  Avoid subscribing explicitly

<Appear>

### You can build an entire Angular app using RxJS everywhere without ever using the word "susbscribe"

- Use the async pipe for template bindings
- Use effects (Store or ComponentStore) to execute actions

These things use subscriptions internally.

They also manage ubsubscription, so you don't have to!

### Service extending ComponentStore

<Appear>

<table>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td>component.ts</td>
<td>component.store.ts</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td>

- Diminished role
  - Only job is wiring up bindings between template, inputs, outputs and store
- Only injected provider is the store

</td>
<td>

- All logic for component lives here
  - Embodied in selectors, updaters and effects
- All additional services, providers needed by the component get injected here
  - Referenced by selectors and effects

</td>
</tr>

</table>

</Appear>

---

# Testing


<Appear>

<table>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td>component.ts</td>
<td>component.store.ts</td>
</tr>



<tr>
<td></td>
<td>

- Instantiate and test using ATL
- Only need to test that selectors, updaters, effects in store are being called

</td>
<td>

- Instantiate and test using <br/> `new SomeComponentStore(...providers)`
- Selectors, updaters, effects are tested like any other methods
 - Clear division of responsibility makes testing easy

</td>
</tr>


</table>

</Appear>

---

# Sharing stores between components

- Take advantage of Angular's [hierarchical dependency injection](https://angular.io/guide/hierarchical-dependency-injection) system to share ComponentStores with child/descendent components
- Can use a shared ComponentStore for a complex component built up of multiple child components, or an entire feature

---

<CodeSurferColumns>

<Step>

```ts
@Component({
  selector: 'parent',
  templateUrl: './parent.component.html',
  providers: [ParentStore],
})
export class ParentComponent {
  constructor(
    readonly store: ParentStore
  )
}
```

```ts
@Component({
  selector: 'child',
  templateUrl: './child.component.html',
})
export class ChildComponent {
  constructor(
    readonly store: ParentStore
  )
}
```

</Step>

</CodeSurferColumns>

---

# Additional observations

<Appear>

- Apps look very different when you use reactive patterns
- May be disorienting at first but much more readable once you get used to it
- Less dependence on lifecycle hooks
- All component properties are readonly

</Appear>

---

# Diminished use of <br/>Angular lifecycle hooks

<Appear>

### Rarely (if ever) need to use:

 - NgOnInit
 - AfterViewInit
 - NgOnChanges
 - NgOnDestroy
 - etc.

These timing events don't matter when your code<br/>
is oriented around when observabes emit values

</Appear>

---

# Readonliness

### All component properties are always readonly


<CodeSurfer>

```ts
// This is an antipattern
this.someProperty = someValue;
```

</CodeSurfer>

(Is _that_ radical?)

# Readonliness

<CodeSurferColumns>

<Steps>

<div>
  <h3> Imperative Code </h3>
  <ul>
   <li>Has moving parts: properties of components/services change</li>
   <li>Imperative methods push data around</li>

# Readonliness

<CodeSurferColumns>

<Steps>


<div>
  <h3> Reactive code</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> Components and services don't have moving parts</li>
    <li> Data flows through the app in observable streams</li>
    <li> Observable terminology: "streams", data$, pipe(), tap()</li>
  </ul>
</div>

 <img src={rubeGoldbergFluid} />

</Steps>

</CodeSurferColumns>

---

# Readonliness

- Always make readonliness explicit in declarations
- Scan for non-readonly component properties in code review
  - (code smell)


---

# When/Where should I<br/>use ComponentStore?

<Appear>

- Every _smart_ component should use ComponentStore
- Purely presentational (dumb) components don't need it
- Rule of thumb:
  - If you are considering writing `this.someProperty = someValue`,<br/> stop yourself and add ComponentStore
- ComponentStore is lightweight and performant.
  - Don't worry about having too many ComponentStores

</Appear>

---

# [Reactive style guide](https://jaufgang.github.io/reactive-angular-style-guide/)

<Appear>

- Strongly opinionated
- Consistent - every component service looks the same
- Incomplete
   - Still needs a lot of work

</Appear>

---

# Advantages of radically reactive approach

<Appear>

### Components are structured in a consistent and predictable way:

- All app logic is organized the same way for every component/store
  - Selectors, updaters, effects
- Template binding always use async pipe
  - Only one async pipe for each component using vm$
- Never explicitly subscribing means never needing to explicitly unsubscribe.
- Automatic propagation of change results in simpler code
- Take advantage of OnPush change detection

</Appear>

---

# Pitfalls/ Downsides

- Training / learning curve
- Unfamiliar. Might feel weird at first and be a challenge getting used to
- More code files for each component

---

### "But we already have a large codebase that doesn't use these patterns"

<Appear>

- This pattern lends itself to refactoring component by component, feature by feature

</Appear>

---

# Recap

<Appear>

- Reactive programming is a _programming paradigm_ that can simplify app architecture by streamlining _propagation of change_.
- ComponentStore provides a solid foundation for adopting reactive patterns consistently throughout an Angular app
- Use it to help "Observable all the things"
- Add ComponentStore to every (smart) component
- Put all component app logic in ComponentStore
- Use effects for component methods that have side effects
- Make all component properties `readonly`
- Use vm$ and a single async pipe in all components
- Avoid explicit subscriptions
- Enjoy life more

</Appear>

# Does this feel radical to you or nah?
